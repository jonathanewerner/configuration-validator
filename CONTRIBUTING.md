## Help wanted

See the open issues labeled [`help wanted`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/configuration-validator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## Contributing validators

This project is intentionally void of any validators. It is intended to be pluggable
so you can create other modules that are a collection of validators.

## Committing and Pushing changes

This project uses (or soon will) [`semantic-release`](http://npm.im/semantic-release)
to do automatic releases and generate a changelog based on the commit history. So we
follow [a convention](https://github.com/stevemao/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/master/convention.md)
for commit messages. Please follow this convention for your commit messages.
